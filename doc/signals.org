#+TITLE: Overview of objects and signals

* Objects
  - Process
  - Scheduler
  - Simulator

* Signals
  - Simulation begins
  - Simulation faults (RTS only)
  - Simulation ends
  - Process arrives
  - Process runs (for how long?)
  - Process time quantum expires
  - Process does I/O (for how long? WHS only)
  - Process aging timer expires (MFQS or WHS)
  - Process misses deadline (RTS only)
  - Process exits
  - Process changes priority (WHS only)
  - Process changes queues (MFQS only)
