#+TITLE: Format of event log

* Anatomy of an event message

An event message consists of the following, each separated by a single space:
1. the simulaton's CPU time
2. the event code (see below)
3. the pid, if applicable
4. other event data, if appropriate

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
155 < 45     # pid 45 arrives at cycle 155
155 r 45 9   # pid 45 runs for 9 cycles
160 < 82     # pid 82 arrives at cycle 160
164 > 45     # pid 45 exits at cycle 164
164 r 82 10  # pid 82 runs for 10 cycles
174 x 82     # pid 82's time quantum expires
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Events
- r :: run
- < :: arrival
- > :: exit
- x :: time quantum expire
- ! :: miss deadline
- @ :: i/o
- # :: change priority
- ~ :: change queue
- a :: age timer expire
- [ :: simulation begin
- ] :: simulation end
- F :: simulation faults
